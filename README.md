# sierpinskiTriangles

Little project based on a short video I saw where you draw a sierpinski triangle. It's done by drawing three corners of a triangle, then drawing a point between two of the points. After that, you iteratively draw a point between the last point you drew and one of the corners of the triangle, selected at random. It takes a lot of points to really demonstrate the effect, so I automated it with a simple python script, then added some fun parts like time it took and a neat color scheme.
